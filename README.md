## Overview

EdgeSync is my research project investigating adaptive data synchronization strategies for applications that span edge devices and cloud infrastructure. I'm building algorithms that can intelligently decide when and how to sync data based on network conditions, application needs, and resource constraints.

## The Problem

Current sync mechanisms for edge-cloud apps are either:
- Too aggressive → waste bandwidth, drain batteries
- Too conservative → users see stale data, conflicts arise
- Static → can't adapt to changing network/app conditions

## My Approach

Building an adaptive sync system that:
1. Monitors network quality in real-time
2. Learns application access patterns
3. Predicts optimal sync timing
4. Handles conflicts intelligently

```

## Quick Start (Local Testing)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/edgesync-research.git
cd edgesync-research
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run basic sync simulation
python experiments/local_sync_test.py

# Test adaptive algorithms
python experiments/adaptive_sync_test.py --network-profile mobile
```

## Key Components

### Sync Engine
- Pluggable consistency models (eventual, strong, causal)
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Bandwidth-aware batching

### Network Monitor
- RTT and bandwidth measurement
- Packet loss detection  
- Connection stability tracking

### Adaptive Scheduler
- ML-based sync timing prediction
- Application-aware prioritization
- Resource usage optimization


## Research Goals

- Release open-source framework for edge-cloud sync
- Provide guidelines for app developers
- Advance understanding of adaptive distributed systems
